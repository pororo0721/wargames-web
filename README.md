# Wargames Shop 

## Introduction

I have created a webpage to help revitalize local small shop businesses. The basic store location operating hours and facebook, ebay, and email links are provided so that customers can connect with the store.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I became more familiar with React. Also, I learned how to use usestate and how to write actual CSS code using styled-components.
I learned how to convert location to google map geographic coordinates through react geocode module.


## To be supplemented
Furthermore, I would like to create an e-commerce website where items can be purchased or checked in the store.
